## Overview

This Battleship Game is a web-based implementation of the classic game Battleship. The game includes a player grid and an AI grid, and the objective is to sink all the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

The project is implemented using Ruby with the Sinatra framework and features a modular structure with different components for the game logic, AI opponent, and graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Web-based Gameplay**: Play Battleship directly from your web browser.
- **AI Opponent**: Face off against an intelligent AI opponent that strategically plans its shots.
- **Modular Design**: The project is organized into separate modules for game logic, AI, and the user interface.
- **Random Ship Generator**: Ships are randomly generated, providing a unique game experience.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game initializes with both the player and AI grids, each containing randomly placed ships.
2. **Gameplay**: Players take turns shooting at positions on the opponent's grid. The AI opponent responds with its strategic shots.
3. **Winning**: The game continues until one player sinks all the opponent's ships. The player or AI with the remaining ships wins.
